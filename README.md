# EduTrends Predictions
- By Adam Harris and Fermin Garcia


# Project Description

The purpose of this project is to create a model to indenify risk categories for students based off socioeconomic status 

# Project Goal

The goal of this project is to identify students with high risk ratings to focus additional resources for those students to help them succeed in their acedemics.

# Initial Hypotheses

- Does parents education affect the risk category of students?
- Do students who are on free/reduce lunch have an affect on the risk category
- Does completing a test prep affect risk category ?
- If we cluster the alcohol content into groups, will wines with high alcohol content have a higher quality score on average than wines with lower alcohol content?
- Does volatile acidity level have a correlation with quality of the wine?

- H$_0$: There is no correlation between the risk category and individual features.
- H$_a$:There is a correlation between the risk category and individual features.
